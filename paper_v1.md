## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Datasets

#### 3.1.1 Tufts University Thermal Face Dataset

The Tufts University Thermal Face Dataset represents a comprehensive multimodal collection comprising over 10,000 images across various modalities acquired from a diverse cohort of 113 participants (74 females, 39 males). For our research, we specifically utilized the thermal subset containing approximately 1,400 images. The age distribution spans from 4 to 70 years, with subjects originating from more than 15 countries, thus providing substantial demographic variability. Image acquisition was conducted using a FLIR Vue Pro thermal camera under controlled indoor environmental conditions. Participants were positioned at a standardized distance from the imaging apparatus to maintain consistency. For our investigation, we specifically utilized two subsets: TD_IR_E (Emotion), which contains images depicting five distinct facial expressions (neutral, smile, eyes closed, shocked, and with sunglasses), and TD_IR_A (Around), which encompasses images captured from nine different camera positions arranged in a semicircular configuration around each participant. A significant challenge encountered with this dataset was the pronounced gender imbalance, with approximately 30.32% female and 69.68% male images. To mitigate this imbalance and enhance model robustness, we implemented targeted data augmentation techniques specifically for the underrepresented female class, including controlled geometric transformations and intensity adjustments while preserving critical thermal signature characteristics.

(Example Images from tufts dataset)

#### 3.1.2 Charlotte-ThermalFace Dataset

The Charlotte-ThermalFace Dataset comprises approximately 10,364 thermal facial images from 10 subjects, collected under varying conditions (e.g., distance, head position, temperature). This dataset was not specifically created for gender detection tasks, but we repurposed it for our gender classification research. Based on image characteristics, we infer that data acquisition likely employed a FLIR-based thermal imaging system. In contrast to the Tufts collection, the Charlotte dataset exhibits near-perfect gender balance with approximately 50% female and 50% male images. This balanced distribution provided an advantageous counterpoint to the gender imbalance present in the Tufts dataset.

(Example Images from charlotte dataset)

#### 3.1.3 Combined Dataset

To enhance data diversity and expand the training corpus, we constructed a combined dataset by integrating the Tufts and Charlotte collections following a systematic merging protocol. A significant technical challenge encountered during this integration was the channel discrepancy between datasets—the Charlotte images were originally single-channel thermal representations, whereas the Tufts dataset employed a three-channel format. To address this incompatibility, we implemented channel replication for the Charlotte images, duplicating the single thermal channel across three channels to establish format consistency with the Tufts data structure. Furthermore, to prevent model bias towards the overrepresented class, we carefully balanced the gender distribution by selecting an equal number of images per gender category through strategic sampling. This integration yielded a substantially enlarged dataset of approximately 11,921 images with perfect gender balance (50% female, 50% male), thereby providing our models with enhanced training diversity spanning different thermal imaging conditions, acquisition parameters, and subject characteristics.

In addition to the primary datasets, we designed cross-dataset experimental protocols to rigorously evaluate model generalization capabilities across different thermal imaging domains. These experiments comprised two principal configurations: Tufts-to-Charlotte (training on Tufts data and evaluating on Charlotte) and Charlotte-to-Tufts (training on Charlotte and evaluating on Tufts). This cross-domain validation approach enables assessment of our models' ability to generalize across varying thermal imaging conditions, camera specifications, and data collection protocols—a critical factor for real-world deployment scenarios where thermal imaging parameters may differ substantially from training conditions.

**Table 1: Summary of Datasets**

| Dataset    | Size (Images) | Gender Distribution     | Channels                        |  
|------------|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| Tufts      | ~1,400        | 30.32% F, 69.68% M      | Three (thermal representation)  |  
| Charlotte  | ~10,000       | 50.10% F, 49.90% M      | One (thermal grayscale)        |  
| Combined   | ~11,921       | 50.00% F, 50.00% M      | Three-channel format           | 


## 3.2 Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

Our data preprocessing and augmentation pipeline was meticulously designed to address the unique challenges of thermal facial image analysis for gender classification. The pipeline incorporated several carefully considered stages to ensure optimal model performance and generalization.

### 3.2.1 Dataset Organization and Partitioning

We structured our datasets according to a standardized hierarchical organization to facilitate efficient training and evaluation. Each dataset (Tufts, Charlotte, and Combined) was systematically partitioned into training and testing subsets using a subject-disjoint approach. This critical design choice ensured that images from the same individual never appeared in both training and testing sets, thus preventing identity-based information leakage that could artificially inflate performance metrics. We implemented an 80:20 train-test split ratio, stratified by gender to maintain proportional representation across partitions.

For the Tufts dataset, we addressed the inherent gender imbalance during partitioning, ensuring that the disproportionate male-to-female ratio was consistently reflected in both training and testing subsets. In the Charlotte dataset, the near-perfect gender balance was preserved throughout the partition process. For the combined dataset, we implemented balanced sampling to achieve gender parity while maintaining subject-level separation between training and testing sets.

**Figure 1: Subject-Disjoint Dataset Partitioning Schema** - A diagram showing the hierarchical organization and separation of subjects by gender across train/test splits.


### 3.2.2 Image Normalization and Standardization

Thermal imaging data presents unique challenges due to variations in sensor calibration, environmental conditions, and temperature ranges. To mitigate these issues, we implemented a comprehensive normalization protocol:

All thermal images were normalized using mean-centering with a value of 0.5 and standard deviation scaling of 0.5. This approach was selected over the conventional ImageNet normalization (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) as it proved more effective for thermal imagery during our preliminary experiments, likely due to the fundamentally different intensity distribution characteristics of thermal versus visible spectrum images.

The Charlotte dataset's single-channel thermal images required special handling when used in models designed for multi-channel inputs. For our hybrid models specifically designed for thermal data, we maintained the single-channel representation, utilizing the grayscale transformation to preserve thermal intensity information. For standard RGB-designed architectures, we expanded the single channel through replication to maintain compatibility while preserving the original thermal information.

Images were resized according to model-specific requirements—224×224 pixels for AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet; 299×299 pixels for Inception. This standardization ensured consistent spatial dimensions while preserving the aspect ratio through center cropping, thus maintaining the integrity of facial thermal patterns.

**Figure 2: Thermal Image Normalization Process** - Visual comparison showing raw thermal images alongside their normalized and channel-harmonized versions from both Tufts and Charlotte datasets.

**Table 2: Model-Specific Normalization Parameters**
| Model Type | Input Size | Normalization Values | Channels | Rationale |
|------------|------------|----------------------|----------|-----------|
| AlexNet/VGG/ResNet/EfficientNet | 224×224 | mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5] | 3 | Optimized for thermal intensity distribution |
| Inception | 299×299 | mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5] | 3 | Maintained larger input size for finer detail capture |
| Hybrid Models | 224×224 | mean=[0.5], std=[0.5] | 1 | Preserved original thermal information without channel duplication |


### 3.2.3 Data Augmentation Strategies

We developed a sophisticated augmentation strategy tailored specifically for thermal facial imagery, carefully balancing the need for dataset expansion with the preservation of thermally significant features:

We implemented distinct augmentation pipelines optimized for different network architectures. For RGB-designed models (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet, Inception), we employed a comprehensive suite of transformations including random resized cropping, horizontal flipping, rotation (±15°), brightness and contrast adjustments (±20%), and Gaussian blurring. For our thermal-specific hybrid models, we employed a more conservative approach with grayscale conversion, random resized cropping, horizontal flipping, moderate rotation (±15°), and controlled affine transformations (±10% translation).

To address the pronounced gender imbalance in the Tufts dataset (30.32% female, 69.68% male), we implemented targeted augmentation for the underrepresented female class. This approach involved creating additional augmented samples exclusively for female subjects, effectively doubling the female representation in the training set while preserving the original male samples. This selective augmentation substantially improved class balance without introducing excessive redundancy or overfitting risks.

Our augmentation protocol was carefully calibrated to preserve the thermal signature integrity crucial for gender classification. Specifically, we avoided extreme geometric transformations and color-space alterations that might distort thermally significant facial features. The brightness and contrast adjustments were conservatively parameterized to simulate natural variations in thermal imaging conditions without introducing artifacts that could compromise the intrinsic thermal patterns.

For the combined dataset, we implemented a sophisticated integration protocol that addressed both the channel disparity between datasets and the gender distribution imbalance. To achieve perfect gender balance (50% female, 50% male), we employed controlled sampling from both constituent datasets, ensuring representative inclusion of diverse thermal imaging conditions and subject characteristics while maintaining strict subject-level separation between training and testing partitions.

The final augmented training sets demonstrated substantially enhanced diversity and robustness. For the Tufts dataset, our class-balanced augmentation approach effectively doubled the representation of the underrepresented female class. The combined dataset benefited from both the targeted augmentation and the integration of diverse thermal imaging modalities, resulting in a comprehensive training corpus that captured a wide spectrum of thermal facial characteristics across different acquisition parameters and subject demographics.

This carefully engineered preprocessing and augmentation pipeline provided our models with high-quality, balanced training data while preserving the critical thermal signatures necessary for accurate gender classification in thermal facial imagery.

## 3.3 Proposed CNN Architecture

### 3.3.1 Overview

Our research introduces a sophisticated deep learning framework built upon a modified ResNet-50 architecture, tailored specifically for thermal (single channel) image classification. The selection of ResNet-50 as the foundational backbone is driven by its proven ability to address challenges inherent in training very deep neural networks. A hallmark of ResNet is its use of residual connections, which mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by introducing skip connections that allow gradients to propagate more effectively during backpropagation. This design enables the construction of deeper architectures without compromising performance, a critical advantage when extracting intricate features from complex human faces in thermal imagery.

ResNet-50 strikes an exceptional balance between computational efficiency and representational power. Its 50-layer depth facilitates the hierarchical extraction of features, ranging from low-level details such as edges and textures to high-level semantic patterns, which are essential for discerning subtle gender specific cues in thermal images. Furthermore, initializing the model with pretrained weights from ImageNet provides a robust starting point. Although thermal images differ from natural images, the general visual features learned from ImageNet—such as edge detection and texture analysis—serve as transferable knowledge that can be fine-tuned to adapt to the our domain. This transfer learning approach accelerates convergence and enhances performance, particularly when training data is limited.

The proposed architecture enhances the standard ResNet-50 by integrating three key modifications: a Channel Input Adapter to handle single-channel inputs, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks to improve feature representation, and a redesigned classifier head to optimize classification performance. Each component is meticulously crafted to align with the implementation in the provided code, ensuring consistency between the theoretical design and practical execution.

- **Figure 5**: "Overall Architecture of HybridResNet" - A comprehensive diagram showing the complete model architecture with all components connected, highlighting the modifications to the standard ResNet-50.

### 3.3.2 Channel Input Adapter

Thermal imaging often presents unique challenges due to the prevalence of single-channel grayscale images, whereas pretrained models like ResNet-50 are designed for three-channel RGB inputs. To bridge this gap effectively, we developed a Channel Input Adapter that transforms single-channel inputs into a three-channel representation suitable for the pretrained backbone. Unlike the simplistic approach of replicating the grayscale channel across three dimensions, which imposes a fixed and potentially suboptimal mapping, our adapter employs a learnable transformation to capture nuanced features tailored to the input data.

#### Architecture

The Channel Input Adapter is implemented as a sequence of convolutional layers that progressively process the input. The transformation unfolds as follows:

- **Initial Convolutional Block**: The single-channel input, denoted as \( x \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times H \times W} \), where \( H \) and \( W \) represent the height and width, is processed by a 3×3 convolutional layer with 32 output channels. Padding of 1 is applied to preserve spatial dimensions. This operation is followed by batch normalization to stabilize training and a ReLU activation to introduce non-linearity. The resulting feature map is \( x_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{32 \times H \times W} \).

- **Subsequent Convolutional Block**: The intermediate feature map \( x_1 \) is fed into a second 3×3 convolutional layer, this time reducing the channel dimension to 3, again with padding of 1. Batch normalization and ReLU activation are applied subsequently, yielding the final output \( x_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times H \times W} \), which matches the input requirements of the ResNet backbone.

Mathematically, the transformation can be expressed as:

\[
x_1 = \text{ReLU}\left(\text{BN}\left(\text{Conv}_{3 \times 3, 32}(x)\right)\right)
\]

\[
x_2 = \text{ReLU}\left(\text{BN}\left(\text{Conv}_{3 \times 3, 3}(x_1)\right)\right)
\]

Here, \(\text{Conv}_{k \times k, c}\) represents a convolutional operation with a kernel size of \( k \times k \) and \( c \) output channels, \(\text{BN}\) denotes batch normalization, and \(\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)\) is the rectified linear unit activation function.

The learnable nature of this adapter allows the network to adaptively map the single-channel input to a three-channel space, potentially capturing richer and more relevant features than a static replication method. By employing convolutional layers, the adapter can learn spatially varying transformations, which is particularly advantageous for gender classification in thermal images, where local patterns—such as facial heat distributions or temperature variations—are discriminative. This design enhances the model’s compatibility with pretrained weights while optimizing its ability to process domain-specific data.

**Figure 6**: "Channel Input Adapter Architecture" - A detailed diagram showing the transformation from single-channel input to three-channel output, with the convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation functions clearly labeled.

### 3.3.3 Squeeze and Excitation (SE) Blocks

To enhance the representational power of this model, we integrated Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks throughout the network architecture. SE blocks implement an attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling interdependencies between channels. This approach allows the network to increase its sensitivity to informative features while suppressing less useful ones.

The SE block operates through a two-step process: squeeze and excitation.

- **Squeeze Operation**: This step aggregates global spatial information into a channel descriptor. For convolutional feature maps \( x \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times H \times W} \), where \( C \) is the number of channels, global average pooling is applied:

\[
z_c = \frac{1}{H \times W} \sum_{i=1}^{H} \sum_{j=1}^{W} x_c(i, j), \quad c = 1, 2, \ldots, C
\]

For fully-connected layers with input \( x \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times C} \), where \( B \) is the batch size, a 1D adaptive average pooling is used:

\[
z_c = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} x_b(c)
\]

The result is a channel descriptor \( z \in \mathbb{R}^{C} \) that encapsulates the global context of each channel.

- **Excitation Operation**: The channel descriptor \( z \) is processed through a bottleneck structure comprising two fully-connected layers:

\[
s = \sigma\left(W_2 \cdot \delta\left(W_1 \cdot z\right)\right)
\]

Here, \( W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{\frac{C}{r} \times C} \) reduces the dimensionality with a reduction ratio \( r = 16 \), \( \delta(z) = \text{ReLU}(z) \) introduces non-linearity, \( W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times \frac{C}{r}} \) restores the original dimensionality, and \( \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \) is the sigmoid activation function. The output \( s \in \mathbb{R}^{C} \) represents channel-wise attention weights ranging from 0 to 1.

- **Recalibration**: The original feature maps are scaled by these weights:

- For convolutional layers: \( \tilde{x}_c = s_c \cdot x_c \)
- For fully-connected layers: \( \tilde{x}_b(c) = s_c \cdot x_b(c) \)

This recalibration enhances the emphasis on channels deemed most relevant by the attention mechanism.

**Figure 7**: "Squeeze and Excitation Mechanism" - Visual representation of the squeeze and excitation operations, with mathematical formulations.

We implemented SE blocks that are capable of handling both convolutional feature maps (4D tensors) and fully-connected layers (2D tensors), making the architecture more flexible. For convolutional layers, the SE blocks apply 2D adaptive average pooling before computing attention weights, while for fully-connected layers, they utilize 1D pooling. This adaptive approach ensures that the attention mechanism works effectively throughout the network.

SE blocks are integrated into the ResNet architecture by appending them after the final convolutional layer (conv3) of each bottleneck module within layers 1 through 4. This strategic placement ensures that feature recalibration occurs at multiple abstraction levels, enhancing the model’s ability to prioritize features critical for the classification task.

The standard ResNet classifier, consisting of a single fully-connected layer, is replaced with a more elaborate structure to optimize classification performance and generalization. This redesign addresses the need for robust feature processing and regularization, particularly in the context of gender classification in thermal images.

The classifier head processes the 2048-dimensional feature vector obtained from global average pooling through a multi-layer sequence:

- **First Dropout Layer**: A dropout operation with a probability of 0.5 is applied to the input \( x \in \mathbb{R}^{2048} \), randomly setting half of the features to zero during training to prevent neuron co-adaptation.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: A fully-connected layer reduces the dimensionality from 2048 to 512, followed by a ReLU activation:

\[
x_2 = \text{ReLU}(W_1 x_1 + b_1)
\]

where \( W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{512 \times 2048} \) and \( b_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{512} \) are learnable parameters.

- **SE Block**: An SE block recalibrates the 512-dimensional feature vector, applying the squeeze and excitation operations described earlier to emphasize discriminative features.

- **Second Dropout Layer**: Another dropout operation with a probability of 0.3 provides additional regularization.

- **Output Layer**: A final fully-connected layer maps the features to the number of classes:

\[
y = W_2 x_4 + b_2
\]

where \( W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{\text{num\_classes} \times 512} \) and \( b_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{\text{num\_classes}} \) produce the classification logits.

The full transformation is:

\[
x_1 = \text{Dropout}_{0.5}(x)
\]

\[
x_2 = \text{ReLU}(W_1 x_1 + b_1)
\]

\[
x_3 = \text{SEBlock}(x_2)
\]

\[
x_4 = \text{Dropout}_{0.3}(x_3)
\]

\[
y = W_2 x_4 + b_2
\]


The incorporation of SE blocks enhances the network’s sensitivity to informative features, a crucial capability in gender classification for thermal images, where subtle differences in facial heat distribution can be discriminative. The adaptive nature of the attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically adjust its focus, improving both performance and robustness across diverse datasets.
